Will Stagner and Xingya Wang (no relation to Steve!) are our course assistants. You'll run into them as they answer questions in the discussion forum. They are both graduate students in mathematics at Rice University. </p>

Tam Cheetham-West, Alexis Johnson, Alex Teich, and Wei Wu also helped to create and edit course content. </p>
