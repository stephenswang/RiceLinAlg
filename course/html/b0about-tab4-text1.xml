    <h2>Course Outline</h2>
  </p>
  <p>
This course is divided into four chapters. Each chapter is divided into several sections (or learning sequences), which have questions and exercises embedded within them to help learners review and make connections. </p>
  <p>
For students enrolled in the Verified Certificate program, each chapter also has a homework set attached to it, and there will be a final exam at the end. Students will need to earn at least 65% on the graded elements (the learning sequence exercises, the homework, and the final) to earn the Verified Certificate. </p>
  <p>
We expect that students will spend 4-6 hours per week on the course, if on the Certificate track. Of course, the more you put into the course, the more you'll get out of it! </p>
