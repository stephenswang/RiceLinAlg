\edXsolution{ 
The equation $Ax = v$ has a solution if and only if $v$ is in the span of the columns of $A$.  The span of 
the columns of $A$ might not be all of $\R^m$, but it is a subspace of $\R^m$.

\beginedxtext{Least-Squares Theorem}


{\keya{\bf{Theorem.}}}  
Let $A$ be an $m\times n$ matrix and let $v\in \R^m$.  Then the equation
$A^tAx = A^tv$ is consistent, and any of its solutions will be a least-squares solution 
to the equation $Ax = v$.

\beginedxproblem{Projection Practice 1}{\dpa1}


Let $W$ be the subspace of $\R^4$ spanned by the list $\{w_1; w_2; w_3\}$, where 
$w_1 = \left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ -2 
\end{array} \right]$, $w_2 = \left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ -1 \\ 0 \\ 0 
\end{array} \right], $ and $w_3 = \left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 1 \\ 2 \\ 2 
\end{array} \right]. $  Note that $\{w_1; w_2; w_3\}$ is an orthogonal list.  

Let $v = \left[\begin{array}{c} 2 \\ 2 \\ -3 \\ 4 
\end{array} \right].$  What is the closest vector to $v$ in $W$?

\beginedxproblem{Projection Practice 2}{\dpa1}

Recall that $C[0,1]$ is the vector space of continuous functions on the interval $[0,1]$, and that
we have an inner product on that vector space given by $\langle f, g \rangle = \int_0^1 f(x)g(x) \ dx$.  


Let $W$ be the subspace of $C[0,1]$ which is the span of a single function 
$f(x) = x$.  

Let $g(x) = x^2$.  What is the orthogonal projection of $g$ onto $W$?
