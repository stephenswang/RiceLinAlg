\beginedxtext{Preliminaries}




The goal of this sequence is to introduce Fourier approximations.  This is an application of orthogonal projections that is useful in a number of areas, such as audio compression.  This will not be covered on the final exam.  


For time budgeting purposes, this sequence has 1 video totaling 10 minutes, 
plus some questions.

\beginedxproblem{Distance Between Functions}{\dpa4}

The vector space $C[0,1]$ of continuous functions on the interval $[0,1]$ is given the inner product $\langle f,g\rangle = \int_0^1 f(t)g(t) \ dt.$
In this space, what is the distance between the functions $f(t) = t^2$ and $g(t) = t$?  


You can type sqrt(2) for $\sqrt{2}$.

\edXabox{type="numerical" expect="sqrt(1/30)" feqin="1" tolerance=".01"}

\edXsolution{
Recall that the distance between $f$ and $g$ is given by $\|f-g\|$, or, equivalently, 
$\sqrt{\langle f-g, f-g \rangle }$.  

We can calculate 
\[
\langle f-g, f-g \rangle = \int_0^1 (t^2-t)^2 \ dt = \frac{1}{30}.\]

Hence the distance is $\sqrt{\frac{1}{30}}$.  
These functions are pretty close to one another on the interval  $[0,1]$!

\beginedxproblem{Shortest Distance}{\dpa1}

True or False: If $V$ has an inner product, and $W$ is a finite-dimensional subspace of $V$, and $v\in V$, then
there is a vector $w\in W$ which is closer to $v$ than any other vector in $W$ is.  

\edXabox{expect="True" options="True","False"}

\edXsolution{ True!  We can find an orthogonal basis of $W$ (e.g., via Gram-Schmidt) and take the orthogonal
projection of 
$v$ onto $W$.  We have proven that the projection is closer to $v$ than any other vector in $W$.
