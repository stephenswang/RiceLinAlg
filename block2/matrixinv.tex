\beginedxvertical{What is an inverse function?}

\beginedxproblem{Cube roots}{\dpa1}

If $\ f(x) = x^3$, then here are some values of $\ f$:
\begin{align*} f(-11) &= -1331 \\ f(12) &= 1728 \\  f(-13) &= -2197. \end{align*}  

Let $g(y) = \ds{\sqrt[3]{y}}$.  What is $g(-2197)$?

\edXabox{type="numerical" expect="-13"}

\edXsolution{ $f(x)$ and $g(y)$ are inverse functions. We see above that $f(x)$ evaluated at -13 is -2197. Since $g(y)$ and $f(x)$ perform opposite actions, we know that g evaluated at -2197 is -13.

{\keya{\bf{Definition.}}}  
If $T: V \rightarrow W$ and $S: W \rightarrow V$ are linear transformations, we say that
$S$ and $T$ are {\keyb{\bf{inverses}}} of one another if $S(T(v)) = v$ for all $v\in V$, and
$T(S(w)) = w$ for all $w\in W$.  If this is the case, we can write $S = T\inv$ and $T = S\inv$.  

If $S = T\inv$ exists we say that $T$ is {\keyb{\bf{invertible}}}.  

{\keya{\bf{Proposition.}}} A linear transformation $T$ is invertible if and only if it is both into and
onto.  

{\keya{\bf{Definition.}}}   
If $A$ is an $m\times n$ matrix and $B$ is an $n\times m$ matrix, we say that 
$A$ and $B$ are {\keyb{\bf{inverses}}} of one another if $AB = I_m$ and $BA = I_n$. If this is the case, we can write $B = A\inv$ and $B = A\inv$.  

If $B = A\inv$ exists we say that $A$ is {\keyb{\bf{invertible}}}.

\beginedxvertical{Into, Onto, and Invertibility}






\beginedxproblem{Into and Onto}{\dpa1}

We've noted that a linear transformation has an inverse if and only if it is both into and onto.  
Let's recall our results about when a linear transformation from $\R^n$ to $\R^m$ can or must
be into or onto.  

Suppose $T: \R^n \rightarrow \R^m$ is a linear transformation.


If $n<m$, what can we conclude about $T$?  

\edXabox{expect="T might be into, or might not" options="T must be into","T might be into, or might not","T cannot be into"}

\edXabox{expect="T cannot be onto" options="T must be onto","T might be onto, or might not","T cannot be onto"}


If $n>m$, what can we conclude about $T$?  

\edXabox{expect="T cannot be into" options="T must be into","T might be into, or might not","T cannot be into"}

\edXabox{expect="T might be onto, or might not" options="T must be onto","T might be onto, or might not","T cannot be onto"}



% If $n=m$, what can we conclude about $T$?  (Check all that apply.)  

% \edXabox{expect="T might be into, or might not" options="T must be into","T might be into, or might not","T cannot be into}

% \edXabox{expect="T might be onto, or might not" options="T must be onto","T might be onto, or might not","T cannot be onto}

\edXsolution{ 	If $n<m$,  $T$ might or might not be into.  However, we have shown that it cannot be onto.
If $n>m$, the reverse is true.  You may wish to review the section on Into and Onto if this is unfamiliar.

\beginedxproblem{When is invertible possible?}{\dpa1}

Again, let $T: \R^n \rightarrow \R^m$ be a linear transformation.  Given the above, 
if $n<m$, is it possible for $T$ to be invertible?

\edXabox{expect="No" options="Yes","No"}

If $n>m$, is it possible for $T$ to be invertible?

\edXabox{expect="No" options="Yes","No"}

\edXsolution{ We know that, if $n<m$ or if $n>m$, $T$ can't be both into and onto. Therefore, in neither case could $T$ be invertible. }

\beginedxvertical{Invertible Matrix Theorem}


\beginedxtext{Inverse Definitions}

{\keya{\bf{Invertible Matrix Theorem.}}}  Suppose that $T: \R^n \rightarrow \R^n$ is a linear transformation
with (square) standard matrix $A$.  Then the following conditions are all equivalent (i.e., either all of
them are true, or all of them are false):

\begin{enumerate}
\item $T$ is into.
\item $\mathrm{Ker}(T) = \{ \veco \}$.  
\item The columns of $A$ are linearly independent. 
\item $Ax = \veco$ has only the trivial solution.
\item $A$ row reduces to have a pivot in every column (has no free variables).  
\item $A$ row reduces to the identity matrix.  
\item $A$ row reduces to have a pivot in every row.  
\item For every $v\in \R^n$, the equation $Ax = v$ is consistent.
\item The columns of $A$ span $\R^n$.  
\item $T$ is onto.  
\item $T$ is invertible.
\item $A$ is invertible.

\end{enumerate}

Note: There will be more equivalent conditions added to this list in the near future!

\beginedxproblem{Using the Invertible Matrix Theorem}{\dpa1}

Suppose $A$ is an $m\times n$ matrix which has at least one free variable.  Can we conclude that the columns of 
$A$ do not span $\R^m$?  

\edXabox{expect="No" options="Yes","No"}

Suppose $A$ is an $n\times n$ matrix which has at least one free variable. Can we conclude that the columns of $A$ do not span $\R^n$?  

\edXabox{expect="Yes" options="Yes","No"}

\edXsolution{ For the first question, we cannot make that conclusion, since we are not told the matrix is square.  For instance, $\left[ \begin{array}{ccc} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \end{array} \right]$ has a free variable,
but its columns span $\R^2$.  

For the second question, we know the matrix is square, so the Invertible Matrix Theorem applies.
Since $A$ has a free variable, we can conclude that none of the conditions in the Invertible Matrix Theorem
are true.  In particular, its columns do not span $\R^n$.

{\keya{\bf{Proposition.}}}  If  $A$ and $B$ are square matrices, and 
$AB = I$, then $BA = I$, and the two matrices are inverses of each other.  


This allows us to add two lines to the Invertible Matrix Theorem: 

{\keya{\bf{Invertible Matrix Theorem (updated).}}}  
Suppose that $T: \R^n \rightarrow \R^n$ is a linear transformation
with (square) standard matrix $A$.  Then the following conditions are all equivalent (i.e., either all of
them are true, or all of them are false):

\begin{enumerate}
\item $T$ is into.
\item $\mathrm{Ker}(T) = \{ \veco \}$.  
\item The columns of $A$ are linearly independent. 
\item $Ax = \veco$ has only the trivial solution.
\item $A$ row reduces to have a pivot in every column (has no free variables).  
\item $A$ row reduces to the identity matrix.  
\item $A$ row reduces to have a pivot in every row.  
\item For every $v\in \R^n$, the equation $Ax = v$ is consistent.
\item The columns of $A$ span $\R^n$.  
\item $T$ is onto.  
\item $T$ is invertible.
\item $A$ is invertible.
\item There is a matrix $B$ such that $AB = I_n$.  ($A$ has a right inverse.)
\item There is a matrix $B$ such that $BA = I_n$.  ($A$ has a left inverse.)

\edXsolution{
The matrix equation stated above has a solution because $T$ is onto, and it has a unique solution because $T$ is into. The other parts of the answer are directly from the IMT.
